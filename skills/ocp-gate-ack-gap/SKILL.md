# OCP Admin Gate Acknowledgment Analysis

Verify that admin gates from the baseline OpenShift version are properly acknowledged in the target version's managed-cluster-config.

## When to Use

- Planning managed cluster upgrades (OSD, ROSA)
- Validating upgrade readiness
- Identifying missing acknowledgment files
- Detecting unacknowledged admin gates that would block upgrades
- CI/CD pipelines that need to verify upgrade prerequisites

## Workflow

1. Parse baseline and target versions (default: auto-detect latest stable → latest candidate)
2. Detect upgrade type (z-stream vs cross-minor):
   - **Z-stream** (e.g., 4.19.30 → 4.19.31): Validates gates from 4.19 against acks in 4.20 (next minor)
   - **Cross-minor** (e.g., 4.19 → 4.20): Validates gates from 4.19 against acks in 4.20
3. Fetch admin gate ConfigMap from cluster-version-operator repo (baseline version)
4. Check if admin gates exist in the ConfigMap's `data` field
5. Fetch admin acknowledgment ConfigMap from managed-cluster-config repo (ack check version)
6. Validate acknowledgment structure based on gate presence:
   - **If gates exist**: Both `config.yaml` AND `admin-ack.yaml` MUST be present, all gates must be acknowledged
   - **If no gates**: Both files MUST be absent (directory should not exist)
7. Report upgrade readiness status and generate detailed reports

## Script Usage

**Single version (recommended):**
```bash
# Auto-resolves baseline and target
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --version 4.22

# Using environment variable
OPENSHIFT_VERSION=4.22 python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py

# 5.x versions (special baseline mapping)
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --version 5.0   # 4.22 → 5.0
OPENSHIFT_VERSION=5.1 python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py  # 4.23 → 5.1

# With verbose output
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --version 4.22 --verbose

# Dry-run mode
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --version 4.22 --dry-run

# Custom report directory
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --version 4.22 --report-dir /custom/reports
```

**Explicit baseline and target:**
```bash
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py \
  --baseline <version> \
  --target <version> \
  [--report-dir <path>] \
  [--verbose] \
  [--dry-run]

# Examples (uses minor versions: 4.21, 4.22)
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --baseline 4.21 --target 4.22
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --baseline 4.21.7 --target 4.22.0 --verbose
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --baseline 4.21 --target 4.22 --dry-run
```

**Auto-detect (no arguments):**
```bash
# Compares latest stable → latest candidate
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py

# Custom report location
REPORT_DIR=/ci-artifacts python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py
```

**Generated Reports:**
```bash
reports/gap-analysis-ocp-gate-ack_4.21_to_4.22_20260327_120000.html  # HTML
reports/gap-analysis-ocp-gate-ack_4.21_to_4.22_20260327_120000.json  # JSON
```

**Exit Codes:**
- `0`: Validation PASSED (CHECK #5 valid - all gates acknowledged or no gates required) OR dry-run mode
- `1`: Validation FAILED (CHECK #5 failed - missing acknowledgment file or unacknowledged gates) OR execution failure (e.g., missing tools, network errors, invalid versions)

**Version Resolution:**
- `--version` flag > `OPENSHIFT_VERSION` env var > `--baseline` AND `--target` (both required) > `BASE_VERSION` AND `TARGET_VERSION` (both required) > Auto-detect
- Auto-detect: latest stable (baseline) → latest candidate (target)
- Uses minor versions (4.21, 4.22) for file lookups

## Key Validation Checks

1. **Admin Gates Existence**: Checks baseline version for admin gates
2. **Acknowledgment Structure** (conditional):
   - **If gates exist**: Both `config.yaml` AND `admin-ack.yaml` must be present
   - **If no gates**: Both files must be absent
3. **Gate Acknowledgments**: When gates exist, ensures all baseline gates are acknowledged in target
4. **Config Validation**: When files exist, validates `config.yaml` has correct baseline version
5. **Extra Acknowledgments**: Reports any extra acknowledgments (informational)

## Upgrade Readiness States

### ✅ UPGRADE READY
**Scenario 1: No gates in baseline**
- No admin gates exist in baseline version
- Both `config.yaml` and `admin-ack.yaml` are absent in target directory
- Acknowledgment directory correctly does not exist

**Scenario 2: Gates exist and acknowledged**
- Admin gates exist in baseline version
- Both `config.yaml` and `admin-ack.yaml` are present in target directory
- All admin gates are properly acknowledged in `admin-ack.yaml`
- `config.yaml` has correct baseline version reference

### ❌ UPGRADE NOT READY (Blocked)
**Structure validation failures:**
- **Gates exist but files missing**: Gates in baseline but `config.yaml` or `admin-ack.yaml` missing
- **No gates but files present**: No gates in baseline but `config.yaml` or `admin-ack.yaml` exist
- **Partial structure**: Only one file present (both must be present together or absent together)

**Content validation failures:**
- **Unacknowledged Gates**: One or more gates exist in baseline but not acknowledged in target
- **Invalid config.yaml**: Baseline version mismatch or structural errors

## Output

The script outputs log messages and exits based on validation result:

[ERROR] ❌ UPGRADE NOT READY: 4.20 → 4.21
```

Exit code: `1` (validation FAILED - CHECK #5, upgrade not ready)

## Warnings (Optional)

If orphaned acknowledgment files are detected (both files present but no gates):
```
⚠️ Warnings
- No admin gates found in cluster-version-operator for version 4.21, but unexpected admin-ack.yaml file is present in managed-cluster-config
  File: deploy/osd-cluster-acks/ocp/4.21/admin-ack.yaml
  Introduced in: https://github.com/openshift/managed-cluster-config/pull/2657
```

**Acknowledgment File Names:** Either `admin-ack.yaml` OR `admin-gates.yaml` is acceptable (script checks for both).

**Validation Rules (when no gates exist):**
- Both files present (acknowledgment + config) → WARNING (exit 0)
- Only one file present → FAIL (exit 1)
- Neither file present → PASS (exit 0)

**Note:** Warnings are informational and do not cause the script to fail (exit 0). They help identify orphaned files that may need cleanup.

**Admin Gates (Baseline):**
- Repository: `openshift/cluster-version-operator`
- Branch: `release-{version}` (e.g., `release-4.21`)
- File: `install/0000_00_cluster-version-operator_01_admingate_configmap.yaml`
- URL: https://github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator/blob/release-4.21/install/0000_00_cluster-version-operator_01_admingate_configmap.yaml

**Admin Acknowledgments (Target):**
- Repository: `openshift/managed-cluster-config`
- Branch: `master`
- File: `deploy/osd-cluster-acks/ocp/{version}/admin-ack.yaml` (e.g., `4.22`)
- URL: https://github.com/openshift/managed-cluster-config/blob/master/deploy/osd-cluster-acks/ocp/4.22/admin-ack.yaml

## Use in CI/CD

```bash
# Exit code reflects validation result: 0=PASSED, 1=FAILED
if python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --baseline 4.20 --target 4.21; then
  echo "✅ Upgrade ready"
else
  echo "❌ Upgrade blocked - check reports for details"
fi

# Use JSON report for programmatic analysis
python3 ./scripts/gap-ocp-gate-ack.py --baseline 4.20 --target 4.21
if jq -e '.summary.upgrade_ready == false' reports/gap-analysis-ocp-gate-ack_*.json >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "❌ Upgrade not ready"
  jq -r '.analysis.unacknowledged_gates[]' reports/gap-analysis-ocp-gate-ack_*.json
  exit 1
fi
```

## Remediation Actions

**If acknowledgment file is missing:**
1. Create file: `deploy/osd-cluster-acks/ocp/{target_version}/admin-ack.yaml`
2. Add acknowledgments for all required gates from baseline
3. Submit PR to `openshift/managed-cluster-config`

**If gates are unacknowledged:**
1. Add missing gate acknowledgments to existing file
2. Ensure gate names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Submit PR to `openshift/managed-cluster-config`

**Example acknowledgment file structure:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: admin-acks
  namespace: openshift-managed-upgrade-operator
data:
  ack-4.20-example-gate: "true"
  ack-4.20-another-gate: "true"
```

## Going Beyond the Script

**Manual verification:**
```bash
# Check baseline admin gates
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator/release-4.20/install/0000_00_cluster-version-operator_01_admingate_configmap.yaml"

# Check target acknowledgments
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/managed-cluster-config/master/deploy/osd-cluster-acks/ocp/4.21/admin-ack.yaml"
```

**Understanding Admin Gates:**
- Admin gates are safety mechanisms that require explicit acknowledgment before upgrades
- They typically indicate breaking changes or important notices
- Managed clusters (OSD/ROSA) require acknowledgment in managed-cluster-config
- Self-managed clusters can acknowledge via oc CLI

**Integration with Full Gap Analysis:**
- When run via `./scripts/gap-all.sh`, this check is included automatically
- Combined report includes OCP gate acknowledgment status
- Helps ensure comprehensive upgrade readiness validation
